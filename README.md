This is a use case for the TraceParts' Gateway in the language **Php**. 

You will find everything to use and understand the Gateway and its different calls. 

 

The TraceParts API Gateway allows you to use a set of new API endpoints, in compliance with the REST API standards. 

The usual HTTP features are used, such as POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, as well as the standard error response codes. 

All responses use the JSON standard. 

All endpoints currently supported are listed in the “[API Reference](https://developers.traceparts.com/v2/reference)” section, with an all new real-time and interactive documentation, giving you the possibility to use the endpoints, with your own Bearer, in different programming languages. 

In the “[Guide](https://developers.traceparts.com/v2/docs)” section, you find the very popular use case to add the 3D viewer and the CAD Download capabilities to the product pages of your own website. 

 

The project structure matches the structure of the documentation that you can find in the [API Reference](https://developers.traceparts.com/v2/reference) section of the online documentation.
